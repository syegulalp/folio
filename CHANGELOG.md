# Changelog

## [0.0.2-alpha](https://github.com/syegulalp/folio/releases/tag/0.0.2-alpha)

### New features

* Ctrl-Shift-F takes you to the Search screen when not editing an article.
* Added a simple caching system for article texts. This speeds up things somewhat with wikis that are mainly being browsed. (We already have a sidebar caching system, which provided some speedup, but this enhances that further.)
* Link insert button in article editor. (Hotkey: Ctrl-L when editor is in focus.)
* Metadata editor for articles.
* Tag and image chooser in editor now show default choices instead of requiring you to type to show anything.
* Bold/ital command buttons in editor.
* Wikis can now be deleted.

### Bugfixes

* Metadata wasn't extracted properly from mixed formatted/unformatted content
* Reloading delete-confirmation page sometimes destroyed data.
* Metadata didn't migrate properly between drafts and published articles.

## [0.0.1-alpha](https://github.com/syegulalp/folio/releases/tag/0.0.1-alpha)
